[16] CCS &#39;20<br>
Xiaolong Bai, Luyi Xing, Min Zheng, Fuping Qu. "iDEA: Towards Static Analysis on the Security of Apple Kernel Drivers". To appear in the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), 2020.
[pdf](http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/luyixing/bib/CCS20-iDEA.pdf), [source code -- 15K lines of code for the static analysis of Apple driver binaries](https://github.com/luyixing/Driver-Security-Analyzer)<br><br>
[Impact: research results (security patches) were implemented in iOS/macOS/iPadOS/watchOS kernels by Apple. Apple adopted our tool iDEA for kernel vulnerability detection.]<br><br>

[15] CCS &#39;20<br>
Tao Lv, Ruishi Li, Yi Yang, Kai Chen, Xiaojing Liao, XiaoFeng Wang, Peiwei Hu, Luyi Xing. "RTFM! Automatic Assumption Discovery and Verification Derivation from Library Document for API Misuse Detection". To appear in the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), 2020.
[pdf](http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/luyixing/bib/CCS20-rtmf.pdf)<br><br>

[14] CCS &#39;20<br>
Haoran Lu, Luyi Xing*,Yue Xiao, Yifan Zhang, Xiaojing Liao, Xiaofeng Wang, Xueqiang Wang.
"Demystifying Resource Management Risks in Emerging Mobile App-in-App Ecosystems." To appear in the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), 2020.

(* Corresponding author.) 
(The first author is my student co-advised by Xiaojing.)<br><br>
[Impact: research results (enhanced security design including isolation and access control) were implemented by Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Wechat, Alipay.]<br><br>

[13] USENIX Security &#39;20<br>
Bin Yuan, Yan Jia, Luyi Xing*,
Dongfang Zhao, Xiaofeng Wang, Deqing Zou, Hai Jin, Yuqing Zhang.

(The first two authors are my students.)<br><br>
[Impact: research results (access-control design and patches) were implemented by IoT products of Samsung SmartThings, Philips Hue, IFTTT, Tuya, Google.]<br><br>

[12] S&P &#39;20 (Oakland)<br>
Yan Jia, Luyi Xing, 
Yuhang Mao, Dongfang Zhao, Xiaofeng Wang, Shangru Zhao, Yuqing Zhang.

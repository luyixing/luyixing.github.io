This website is under construction.

The prior working website is [https://www.xing-luyi.com](https://www.xing-luyi.com).

I am an Associate Professor in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I was a tenure-track Assisant Professor, then a tenured Associate Professor in Computer Science at IU Bloomington. Before academia, I dedicated a few years building/engineering large commercial systems at Amazon/AWS. Now I'm directing the System Security Foundations lab at UIUC. I am a recipient of Outstanding Junior Faculty Award of Indiana University Bloomington (class of 2024), NSF CAREER award (2021, cloud-based IoT systems security), Facebook Research Award (2021, Privacy Enhancing Technologies), 5 Facebook Whitehat awards (2012, 2013, 2020, 2021), Google Developer Data Protection award (2019), Microsoft Whitehat award (2019), Android Security Acknowledgements (2013 - 2016, 2018), Apple Security Acknowledgement (2015, 2019, 2020), among others.

Research I led has significantly and extensively changed security design (access control, authentication) in apps/systems that people use everyday, across Android, iOS/iPad/MacOS, Chrome, Apple Home (HomeKit), Google Home, SmartThings, Facebook, AWS IoT, Azure IoT, etc., which have implemented and deployed our security designs/protections. My research is featured with formal methods and guarantees for security and privacy-compliance in systems, in particular, IoT, cloud, mobile, and software supply chain. My research have led to the discovery of 60+ new types of vulnerabilities in the design of commercial and open-source systems, uncovering novel attack techniques. What my group focused on are typically fundamental design challenges (see our media reports and publications), versus implementation bugs/mistakes. Our research has been reported by [Time](http://time.com/3926501/apple-security-mac-iphone/), [CNN](https://money.cnn.com/2015/06/18/technology/apple-keychain-passwords/), [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/06/17/big-flaws-in-apple-oses/), [Mirror](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/apple-samsung-devices-at-risk-5905176), [Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/06/17/warning-major-iphone-security-flaw-lets-hackers-steal-all-your-passwords/), [Yahoo](http://news.yahoo.com/android-flaw-lets-hackers-hijack-175339634.html), [CNET](http://www.cnet.com/news/your-mobile-app-has-serious-security-flaws/), [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/06/17/apple_hosed_boffins_drop_0day_mac_ios_research_blitzkrieg/), and more.
